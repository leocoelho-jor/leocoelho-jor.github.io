# Esse é o site que eu escolhi para ser meu portifólio.

Ele foi "forkeado" do criador do github através do [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
para um site estático que eu consigo mexer diretamente no meu celular. Bem mais fácil do que ficar
mexendo no wordpress. Acredite

I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote
server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author
my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and
customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me.
And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data
again.
