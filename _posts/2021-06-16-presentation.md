As a freelance journalist and photographer based in Rio de Janeiro, I have covered (or helped producing) stories on a broad spectrum of subjects for outlets such as  the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/world/americas/bolsonaro-covid-19-brazil.html), the [Latin American Journalism Review](https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/why-so-serious-latin-american-journalists-explore-popular-video-sharing-app-tiktok-to-attract-young-readers/), [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/29/how-brazil-was-ukrainized/), [Intercept Brazil](https://theintercept.com/2020/10/07/qanon-quatro-candidatos-a-vereador-mostram-como-conspiracao-invadiu-estas-eleicoes-municipais/), [Rest of World](https://web.archive.org/web/20200710083321/https://restofworld.org/2020/brazil-social-platforms-glorify-shooters/), [Bellingcat](https://web.archive.org/web/20210621135416/https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/11/07/dogolachan-and-the-ghost-of-massacres-past/), Fox News, [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/brazil-covid-vaccines-worlds-deadliest-daily-record-misinformation-rcna527), [BBC Brasil](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-41543884), [Vice](https://web.archive.org/web/20210514042415/https://www.vice.com/pt/article/4xgben/paisagens-complexas), [Noisey](https://web.archive.org/web/20201211102131/https://www.vice.com/pt/article/ryv8qj/feira-sao-cristovao-happy-hour-fotos), Correio Braziliense, Congresso em Foco, Ponte Jornalismo and UOL. 

My photojournalism work has been published in [Newsweek](https://web.archive.org/web/20180825045755/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2F2016%2F11%2F18%2Fbrazil-black-power-girls-activism-marielle-franco-519400.html), [Morgenbladet](https://web.archive.org/web/20180825052112/https%3A%2F%2Fmorgenbladet.no%2F2016%2F07%2Foppror-i-alle-retninger), and [Lenny Letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20180825050348/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lennyletter.com%2Fstory%2Ftombamento), among others.

I’ve also worked as a producer(aka fixer) for the New York Times, [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6dfd75c9-579e-445c-82af-2e7c3cb16f9a) and for international TV stations, such as Australia’s [Channel 9](https://leocoelho-jor.github.io/2021/02/18/Channel9.html), and [YLE TV](https://leocoelho-jor.github.io/2021/02/18/tv-yle.html), from Finland. In 2019 I even had experience in [streaming live](https://twitter.com/HappsNews/status/1167159536647430144?s=20) (in english) for Happs News. In video, I was the cameraman for the Bertelmann Foundation in their series ["Crossroads"](https://leocoelho-jor.github.io/2021/02/18/tv-yle.html) in Rio de Janeiro.

Those experiences in reporting, recording, researching and translating (English-Portuguese) show a versatile body of work, attuned with current necessities in multimedia journalism. My work has also allowed me to develop an important network of colleagues and sources in the Brazilian media and institutions. The main issues I cover here are related to the current state of human rights, social policies, far-right, web culture and public security.

In the academic world, I have a masters degree from UFRJ(Rio de Janeiro Federal University) at their professional program on Creative Media (PPGMC); I collaborated as a researcher with BUG404, a a brazilian digital platform about interactive narratives: webdoc, hypervideo, interactive documentary, electronic literature, sound maps.I have communication bachelor's from FACHA-Organização Hélio Alonso de Educação e Cultura (2010). I also have a post-graduation tittle  in "Image and Communication", researching  mainly  the following subjects: culture, cyberculture, comics. Most recently, became interested in the convergence between photojournalism and webdocs.
